talks/projects:
---------------

apply psych principles (conditioning, spaced repetition, whatever else) to UI
so computer can train person to accomplish goals
    prereqs:
        goals (quantified etc.)
        willingness to write UI stuff
        test subjects

    also, time tracking. but easy. this might already exist.

figure out natural-ish makeup to fool security cameras
    prereqs: 
        samples of face recognition software
        makeup
        volunteers?

time management stuff that uses phone debug data dump (screen on times, etc,
like shown on battery history) to make better picture of how time is spent
    prereqs:
        clearer goal
        willingness to touch Android

slides tools stuff (bridge?)

algorithmic complexity and you (in progress)

projects
--------

make personal site cool like about page of http://maryrosecook.com/

*new internet*: automatically hide all links to anything it knows you've seen
before -- gracefully skip repeated images by repeating whatever action got you
the new one (rightarrow), gray out URLs, count how often a URL is linked from
things you browse. Visualize net of the internet pages one actually visits,
and net of "potential interests" that're often linked from things you go to
but haven't been clicked yet.

Bobcat Box of Books: kinda like http://www.bobcatinabox.com/ but $5/month and
send books it thinks you'll like, or which complete your collection, or w/e 
    prereqs: 
        home library catalog type sw
        db of similarities between books -- Dewey + Amazon ratings??
        willingness (or painlessness) to actually catalog all existing books
            -- maybe catalog input by ISBN and prints a QR to stick on the
            spine so a photo of the shelf can tell you what's on it via OCR?
        more space to store books
            -- maybe include a thing for automatically auctioning disliked or
            irrelevant books from collection, to fund the habit of acquiring
            more?

Label the Cookies
-----------------

http://edunham.net/2015/02/04/please_license_your_code.html would do super
well with a thingy that uses the GitHub API and you give it a GH username and
it looks at all their public repos and repos contributed to and points out
which ones are missing a LICENSE file


vanity domains
--------------

put in a precise nick and it finds for each 2 or 3-char substring whether a)
that's a TLD, b) the stuff before it is available as a domain. 

falling off the internet
------------------------

of own browsing/download history, find what's NOT on archive.org

combine  http://domaininferno.com/ and archive.org to find the content that
has lost its names

reed->read->red
---------------

i want a thing to track stuff i ought to read eventually. it ought not tell
others, except perhaps publishing summaries/reviews. ought to save a URL of a
post, or download a PDF, or track paper-books, with equal (hopefully lack of)
difficulty. 

could(should)? be command line. might be awkward to enter paperbook data; json
perhaps?

    get: command that records a paperbook title or article topic to encourage
        finding it later

    reed: command that adds a specific instance of something i have access to
        and ought to read, but haven't time right away.

    read: command that gives me something to read, when i have time but not
        ideas. 

    red: some kind of action, summary or review, to take upon having
        successfully read a thing. 

oh also, sorting between topics/hats would be rather nice. dev, ops, psych,
philosophy, robots, meta, news, etc. possibly also handle time constraints?

this might be implement-able as a Taskwarrior plugin. perhaps a 'read' in
/usr/bin that'd swap out the current task in i3bar??

music generated from the environment
------------------------------------

listening to the mirror's edge soundtrack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y05wiQQbFLU at the recommendtation of
http://imgur.com/gallery/fULGO thinking about how ambient, electronic music
could be used as a 6th sense, of sorts, to monitor IoT devices' state. when
something's working correctly it sings along with the house; when off it's
quiet; when something is going wrong with it, it gets discordant. 

could be a gentler reminder of time-sensitive tasks by gradually transitioning
into the times when actions need to be taken, reducing the amount of interrupt
-- for instance, what if the microwave crescendo'd and accelerando'd and then
quit when the food was done, rather than just humm and then beep? the parents'
washing machine plays a little tune when the wash is done rather than
screeching like the drier does, and although it's less unpleasant, it's also
really confusing when random music starts out of nowhere. 

background tempo, pitch, and beats should probably be environmental
temperature, presence/absence in room, electricity usage, etc. 

end goal is to hack greater connectedness with environment via enjoyable,
non-interruptey, subconscious musical cues. 

same thing could potentially be done with systems monitoring -- chunk each
time segment of traffic into a beat, give a rhythm pattern to each service
being monitored, volume is the load on that particular server. i hypothesize
that this would leverage auditory pattern recognition to earlier detect
errors, in the same way that graphs leverage visual pattern recognition. maybe
i'm just a '90s kid but i still vividly recall the tone pattern of the modem
dialing our ISP back in the day, and could tell from any deviations in the
pattern whether it was connecting successfully or not... and that was like
half my life ago. also, stick in a particular melody or "hook" for debug
tracing? 

possible collaboration between houses, as well -- refrigerator could put its
chill cycle after fitbit says you're asleep; appliances could do their
white-noise thing to mask it when the neighbors are being loud. 

hieroglyph2beamer
-----------------

rst2pdf does not meet my needs. sphinx latex builder is too general-purpose.

http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/producing-slide-shows-with-pandoc
is a pandoc thing i guess; http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demos.html
suggests it might be the answer. need to test that out.

extra brain
-----------

do a full arch install on a 64GB USB stick. possibly rsync my ssd onto it
weekly.

something for tracking all these damn projects
-----------------------------------------------

vague ideas, status, idea groups, in-progresses, research.
