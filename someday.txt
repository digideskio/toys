*new internet*: automatically hide all links to anything it knows you've seen
before -- gracefully skip repeated images by repeating whatever action got you
the new one (rightarrow), gray out URLs, count how often a URL is linked from

and net of "potential interests" that're often linked from things you go to
but haven't been clicked yet.

        db of similarities between books -- Dewey + Amazon ratings??
        willingness (or painlessness) to actually catalog all existing books
            -- maybe catalog input by ISBN and prints a QR to stick on the
            spine so a photo of the shelf can tell you what's on it via OCR?
        more space to store books
            -- maybe include a thing for automatically auctioning disliked or
            irrelevant books from collection, to fund the habit of acquiring
            more?
