This repo will keep track of the test code I write, as well as my attempts to
teach Quigley the art of line following. It will also serve as an example to
show other students why version control is seriously awesome when developing
a project like an ORK. 

If my documentation is unclear, feel free to file an issue in the tracker.
Up there at the top of the page, click the word "issues", and the rest should
be self-explanatory :) 

Happy robot-building,
