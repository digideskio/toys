"""
Names: 
    Must contain at least one vowel
    Must contain at least one consonant
    Capitalization doesn't matter
    Every letter must follow a letter that it follows somewhere in the English
    language (so like a Markov chain without probabilities)
    Names must not occur in a dictionary, a dictionary of misspellings, or a
    dump of urbandictionary
    Googling for precisely the name must yield no results (maybe)
    Shorter is better
    Generate all up to n-chars to be searchable for substrings (py, mt, etc.)
